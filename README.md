# machine_learning_homeworks
This contains some of the machine learning code I wrote when taking a machine learning class at the University of Michigan. These projects cover methods such as ridge regression, lasso and support vector machines.

The descent methods used include gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, coordinate descent and subgradient descent.
